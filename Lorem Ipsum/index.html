                        <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>
                        is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br> industry. Lorem Ipsum
                        has been the industry's standard dummy <br> text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                        printer
                        took
                        a galley <br>
                        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br> survived not only five
                        centuries,
                        but also
                        the leap into electronic <br> typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                        popularised
                        in
                        <br> the 1960s
                        with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br> Ipsum passages, and more recently
                        with
                        desktop
                        publishing <br> software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the

                        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of

                        using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',

                        making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing

                        packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their

                        default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved

                        over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose

                        (injected humour and the like).

                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br>
                        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br>
                        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br>
                        professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of <br>
                        the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum <br>
                        passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical <br>
                        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum <br>
                        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum <br>
                        et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in <br>
                        45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br>
                        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem <br>
                        ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is <br>
                        reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and <br>
                        1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also <br>
                        reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English <br>
                        versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

                        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,

                        believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you

                        tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the

                        structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The

                        generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,

                "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of <br>
                pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal <br>
                blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil <br>
                and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and <br>
                when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in <br>
                certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have <br>
                to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he <br>
                rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
